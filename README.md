Radio Tower Frequency Regulator visuals (check for various dials)
Write the plot of the Radio Tower and change it into visual storyboard
Make a visual mock-up of Radio Tower message deciphering mode
Make a mock-up of intro messages for Radio Tower

**Date of conception:** 24th January 2014 - 26th January 2014

Theme: We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.

Radio Towers
communication is perfect

communication >< two radio towers
player needs to decipher the messages
bursts of messages - literary stuff in the air  

PLAYER EXPERIENCE

- Black fade in. 


- In the brief darkness there is a single ping breaching the blackness. We hear a sonar sound / a drone sound representing the frequency.


- Image fades in and we see two towers covered by a thick fog and blizzard. Forest below. A sound of delicate wind is present. Music ambience envelopes the scene. 

- Logo appears “RADIO TOWER” and subtitle “COMMUNICATION IS PREFECT”. Below that “PRESS SPACE TO CONTINUE / PRESS A TO CONTINUE”. 

UX: 

- Once you press it the logo menu appears with “START”, “ABOUT”, “QUIT”. 

- Once you press “START” logo disappears, we start to zoom out and we can see other similar towers. The sound of radio chatter appears. 

- They all ping and then suddenly stop. Radio chatter stops. 

- As we zoom backwards we are taken to a single tower standing in the middle of the forest. 

- A message appears as we slowly drift delicately in space around the tower. The message is in white and has a programmers font feel. It prints itself out below the tower. “REQUESTING CONNECTION…”
[Grant connection] [Ignore it]

- If you choose to accept it the next message appears. If you ignore it, a cell within the tower rings “WE NEED TO TALK IN PERSON, I’M DRIVING OVER”.

- “WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME ON A CELL?! THAT’S ILLEGAL”
- “WHO ARE YOU?”
- “…”

- Car lights are seen in the forest and someone enters the radio tower. Zoom in at the windows on top. Two shapes are visible. 

- “WHAT IS THE MATTER? IS AN INSPECTION COMING?”
- “NO, AND NOT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THE MATTER IS FAR MORE BEWILDERING THAN THAT”

- communication is power 
- communication is control

TYPES OF COMMUNICATION

3kHz - 300 GHz

8 / 16 / 32 / 64 / 128 / 256 / 512 / 1024

- range 1mm- 100km (more distant more corrupted)
- vertical vs horizontal direction (ground-related)
horizontal causing distortions (musk layer) - equal length between clouds and ground
- received / transmitted (schedule of the radio tower)

- perhaps stages of tower (?) or moving to a different tower
height and range increased 

RADIO STORIES

- astronomical objects (naturally occurring radio waves) / messages cohesive messages from unknown sources
- lightning occurrence
- communication satellite experiencing outburst of “white noise”
- message spread (broadcast this task)
- radio bands distribution being withdrawn for unknown reasons (INTERNATIONAL TELEKOM) denying everyone communication
